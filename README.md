# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Overview:
We wanted to analyze all the factors from the loan_stats csv to help us predict whether someone is a high or low risk status for a credit card. We used imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to create our models and used resampling to evaluate.

## Results:
* Naive Random Oversampling results: accuracy score is 64.8% with a precision of 99% and recall of 60%
